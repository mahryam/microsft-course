You will probably want people to fork your project. Forking means creating a replica of your repository on their GitHub profile.
Clone. From there they will clone the project to their local machine.
Create a branch for your work.
Kindly focus their change on one area. - that way the chances that you can merge in their work is higher. Imagine they write a bug fix, add a new feature, and update several tests - what if you want to, or can only implement 2 out of 3, or 1 out of 3 changes?
